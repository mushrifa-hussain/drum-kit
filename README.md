## 🥁 Drum Kit Website

An interactive Drum Kit Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Each drum image corresponds to a specific keyboard key, and when the user presses that key (or clicks the drum), a drum sound plays instantly.

This project demonstrates JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, audio playback, and simple UI animations.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎧 Play drum sounds using keyboard keys (W, A, S, D, J, K, L)
- 🖱 Click support — users can click on drum icons to play sounds
- 🎨 Stylish UI with custom images and hover animations
- ⚡ Instant sound playback using the Audio API
- 💫 Button animation for real-time press effect
- ❤️ Custom footer credit “Made with ❤️ by Mushrifa”

## 📂 How It Works
- Each drum button has an associated key (w, a, s, d, j, k, l).
- JavaScript listens for keydown events.

## When a key is pressed:
- The matching sound file plays
- A brief animation highlights the pressed button

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
- This mini-project was built as part of learning JavaScript fundamentals.
- It helped understand:
- Event listeners
- Handling user input
- Working with audio files
- DOM styling through JavaScript
