# drum-kit
An interactive Drum Kit Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each drum image corresponds to a specific keyboard key, and when the user presses that key (or clicks the drum), a drum sound plays instantly.  This project demonstrates JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, audio playback, and simple UI animations.
